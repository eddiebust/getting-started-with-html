<h1>The Basics of the Web</h1>
<b>How does it work?</b>
<p>The "Web", or Internet, is essentially computers with <em>browsers</em> (Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, etc.) connecting to other<br>
computers, or <em>servers</em>, via <em>HTTP requests</em>.  When you navigate to a webpage, you send a request from your browser to a<br>
server in the form of an HTTP request and an HTML document is returned to your browser. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/e-48230539/m-48742046">This video</a> shows the most basic<br>
components of the Web, and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1hv8sw/eli5how_does_the_internet_work_who_hosts_it_and/cayact8">this comment</a> on an ELI5 (explain like I'm 5) question on <a href="www.reddit.com/">reddit</a> does a great job of explaining<br>
how the internet works in more detail.    
</p>

<b>HTML</b>

<p>HTML is (or <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>), for all intents and purposes, the basis for almost <b><em>everything</em></b> on the internet.<br>
HTML documents are made up of <em>hypertext</em> (what you see) and <em>markup</em> (what it looks like). <a href="www.udacity.com">Udacity</a> has a great video<br>
that shows a basic overview <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340">here</a>.
</p>

<B>Elements of HTML</B>

<p>HTML documents are created by using <em>tags</em>. Tags are used to tell the browser which <em>elements</em> to display.  Another <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">udacity.com video</a><br>
shows different tags and their purpose.
</p>

<b>Block and Inline Elements</b>
<p>Two types of HTML elements, <em>block</em> and <em>inline</em>, differ in the way they handle content.  Block elements create an invisible box,<br>
or <em> container</em>, around the content while inline elements do not.
</p>

<b>HTML Document Structure</b>

<p>A complete HTML document is made up of different elements put together and contain:<br>
<em><b>head</b></em> - where the title, metadata, CSS and Java Script references, etc. are located<br>
<em><b>body</b></em> - where all displayed content (text, images, videos, etc.) is located
</p>

<b>Why We Code</b>

<p>We use <em>code</em> such as HTML because computers are stupid, meaning that they cannot think for themselves; they need to be told<br>
,step-by-step, in their own language , exactly what we need them to do for us.  Also, unlike humans, they are not capable<br>
of <em>abstract thought</em>, so they cannot use past experience to discern the expected outcome and troubleshoot problems.   </p>
